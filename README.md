# optimize-gas
Gas is a fee mechanism implemented by Ethereum to help with transactions. This fee is a fraction of the transaction presented in Wei, which is 10-12 of an Ether. Total fee price depends on the size of the smart contract and its functionality.

This fee price is dependent on the supply and demand and it is used as a payment for the resources consumed by miners in order to process and validate the transaction to the Ethereum Blockchain. With every operation performed, some cost is added for the transaction. A table of the average cost per transaction can be seen below.
